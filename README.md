# Testimonials - Submissions
Front end posting of 'Testimonials by WooThemes' plugin. Form and processing via CMB2 (CMB2 is built in to this plugin)

**This is a 3rd party plugin, no affiliation with WooThemes.**

Use shortcode `[testimonial_form]` to insert the submission form on any WP post/page. Submissions default to a post status of **draft** so they can be manually approved. If you want your submissions to be published immediately you can use the `post_status` attribute in the shortcode. Example `[testimonial_form post_status="publish"]`.
